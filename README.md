Most-Popular-Stories---Compatibility-version
============================================

Android Application. For use with devices with Android 2.1 (Eclair), API 7, or higher.

I have included the  android-support-v7-appcompat library project in the repo. This must be imported as well as the application itself.
The dependencies between the projects should be maintained when the repository is cloned. 

Known Bug: If there is no internet connection on device, the app will crash.
